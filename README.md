# Faster start up? üöÄ

Because of KebabVim's Auto update feature the start up time may be slow **BUT** heres how you can fix it!

### Get faster start up speeds:
- open ~/.config/nvim/init.lua in your favourite code editor and disable the following local variables

```lua
-- SET THESE VARIABLES TO FALSE!!
local AUTO_UPDATE = false
```
